# numix-cinnamon-theme-packaging
This thing creates packages for https://github.com/zagortenay333/numix-cinnamon using https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm

Installing through Spices is cool for a single user, but i want to distribute this excellent theme for a wider setup and set as default (using dconf) for all users. Therefore i need a package for salt/puppet/whateveryoulike.
